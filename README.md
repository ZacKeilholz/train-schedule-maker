## About:

Train-Schedule-Maker is a web app for creating a list of scheduled trains- the arrival times listed are always in relation to the current time, and the schedules will remain posted after refreshing the page or changing computers via Firebase.    

This project was built in HTML/CSS/Bootstrap 4/JS/Jquery and Firebase.  

#### Will eventually: 

1. Look really nice.
2. Filter inadequate time inputs
3. Provide a nice bootstrap warning before the user is allowed to delete from the schedule
4. Play nicely on mobile

## Function:

To use the Train-Schedule-Maker, add a train to the current train list using the form at the bottom of the page- be sure to use military time.  To remove an item from the schedule- press the red 'X' button on the rightmost column.
